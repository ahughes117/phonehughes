A really simple phonebook. Java Desktop Application Front End, MySQL database storage back end.

I have developed this application for myself a lazy non project Sunday and then thought that someone else may find it useful, that's the reason I am uploading the code.

Also parts of the code are also portable since there are used in other projects of mine.
